# Bluetooth Car - AVR-assembler

Intro: This project was the result from the 2019 spring course TSIU51 at Linköping university, Sweden. The goal of the course is to use two ATmega16 microcontrollers and make them communicatate with each other. The project must also be only coded in AVR-assembler. 

Contributors:  Dutsadi Bunliang, Sebastian Börjeteg, Hamid Gholami and Wiktor Isaksson.
